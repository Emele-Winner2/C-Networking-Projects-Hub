# C Networking Projects Hub

This repository is a **collection of networking projects written in C**.
The goal is to experiment with and learn different aspects of networking, including TCP/UDP, HTTP, embedded systems networking, and other protocols. Each project demonstrates low-level networking concepts using the Berkeley sockets API and cross-platform C code.

---

## What This Repository Is For

- Learning **network programming** in C
- Exploring **different network protocols**
- Building **cross-platform networking applications**:
  - Desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Embedded devices (IoT, microcontrollers)

- Practicing **TCP, UDP, HTTP, and custom protocols**
- Experimenting with **servers, clients, and network tools**

└── README.md
```

Each subfolder contains **self-contained projects** with its own source files, headers, and possibly a local Makefile.

---

## Example Projects

- **Minimal TCP Web Server** – A simple HTTP server returning local time
- **UDP Chat** – A basic UDP client/server for sending messages
- **Embedded Network Example** – Networking for microcontrollers using C and sockets
- **Custom Protocol Demo** – Experimenting with custom TCP or UDP protocols

> More projects will be added as experimentation continues.

---

## Building Projects

Each project may include its own **Makefile** or instructions.

Example for a project:

```make
# Inside a project folder
main: main.c ../include/include.h
	gcc -Wall -I../include main.c -o main -lws2_32
```

Then run:

```sh
make
./main
```

> Use `-I../include` or adjust the path to headers as needed.

---

## Running Projects

Most projects are **command-line programs**:

- **Servers**: run first, listen on a TCP/UDP port
- **Clients**: connect to server or send messages

Example:

```sh
# Run server
./server

# Connect from client
./client
```

---

## Key Concepts Covered

- TCP and UDP socket programming
- Client/Server architecture
- Manual HTTP handling
- Embedded networking concepts
- Cross-platform C networking (Winsock + POSIX)
- Low-level networking debugging and analysis

---

## Contributing / Extending

This repository is designed to **grow over time**:

- Add new networking experiments
- Add comments, docs, or diagrams
- Refactor existing projects for robustness
- Share custom protocols, simulations, or IoT networking experiments
